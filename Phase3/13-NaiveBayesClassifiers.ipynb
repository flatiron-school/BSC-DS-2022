    "> \"Naive Bayes classifiers are linear classifiers that are known for being **simple yet very efficient**. The probabilistic model of naive Bayes classifiers is based on Bayes’ theorem, and the adjective naive comes from the assumption that the features in a dataset are **mutually independent**. In practice, the independence assumption is often violated, but naive Bayes classifiers **still tend to perform very well** under this unrealistic assumption. Especially for small sample sizes, naive Bayes classifiers can outperform the more powerful alternatives.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "* It is an efficient way to predict class of test data set\n",
    "* It perform well in multi class prediction\n",
    "* When assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs requires less training data and can perform better than models like logistic regression\n",
    "* Works very well on a large number of input features (doesn't suffer from the same curse of dimensionality)\n",
    "* Performs better with categorical inputs. For numerical input, one has to assume a normal distribution.\n"

    "\n",
    "* Naive Bayes is also known as a bad estimator, so the probability outputs from `predict_proba` are not to be taken seriously\n",
    "* We are assuming of independent predictors, but in real life, it is almost impossible that we get a set of predictors which are completely independent (amazingly, still works a lot of the time though!)"
